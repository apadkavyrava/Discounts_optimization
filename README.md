Business Context:
The application periodically emails users with discount offers. The goal is to offer the smallest possible discount that still yields a high probability of purchase.

Solution Overview:
The repository contains a two-stage pipeline that tailors email discounts on a per-user basis:

Purchase Probability Model (XGBoost)
Predicts the likelihood that a user will buy given a specific discount.

Discount Grid Search
Sweeps through candidate discounts and selects the minimum one that reaches the desired purchase-probability threshold.

 A focused mailing list containing only those users who are both likely to convert and the discount percentage required to nudge them over the line.
